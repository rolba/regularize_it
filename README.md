# Brief
You can find here code I use for my regularization experiments. All described on my blog: www.ai-experiments.com

1. r-dropout.py is dealing with dropout and spatial dropout layers. For experiments results please visit: <br>

2. r-l2.py - it a simple experiment with l2 regularization value on a very small model. Post is in progress.<br>
